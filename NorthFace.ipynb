      "Nano puff p/o - Already a cult classic with our ambassadors and testers, the Nano earns unanimous raves for versatility, surprising warmth and terrific all-around performance in a superlight, no-frills package. It's weather-resistant enough to wear as an insulated shell in a wet snowstorm, trim enough to pull on for chilly rock pitches (and still see your footholds), and warm enough for light belay parka duty on quick alpine dashes. The wind-blocking, moisture-shedding DWR (durable water repellent) finished 100% all-recycled polyester shell (1-oz 15-denier) also glides effortlessly, whether worn as an outer or midlayer. Low-bulk, hydrophobic, highly compressible PrimaLoft One (60 g) traps heat with remarkable efficiency, even when wet. The deep front zipper allows for easy ventilation. The Nano also packs down to practically nothing and stuffs into a single chest pocket that has a carabiner clip-in loop.
